paper_representation_graph_prompt = """You are an expert reviewer for the **{conference} conference**. You are provided with a research paper represented as a set of relationships from a knowledge graph. Each relationship is structured as follows:

- **Entity1**: The first entity (e.g., a concept, method, or component in the paper).
- **Relation**: The type of relationship between the two entities (e.g., "improves", "uses", "is based on").
- **Entity2**: The second entity.
- **Description**: A brief description providing additional context about the relationship.

These relationships encapsulate the paper's ideas, technical details, and supporting evidence.

**Example of a Relationship:**

- **Entity1**: "Convolutional Neural Networks"
- **Relation**: "improve"
- **Entity2**: "Image Recognition Accuracy"
- **Description**: "CNNs have been shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of image recognition tasks."

Use this knowledge graph representation to understand the core contributions, strengths, and weaknesses of the paper. Analyze the relationships to form a comprehensive evaluation based on ICLR's review criteria, focusing on originality, quality, clarity, and significance.

Here is the knowledge graph-based representation of the paper you are reviewing:
