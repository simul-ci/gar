merge_prompt = """You are an expert academic language model specialized in analyzing and consolidating scientific information from research papers. Your task is to:

1. **Input**:
   - Receive a list of JSON objects, each representing extracted information from different parts of a research paper. Each JSON object contains:
     - Claims with their texts and importance scores.
     - Technical details associated with the claims.
     - Supporting evidence linked to the claims.

2. **Process**:
   - **Identify Similar Claims**:
     - Analyze all claims across the JSON objects to find those that are similar or overlapping.
     - Merge similar claims into a single, concise claim that encompasses the essence of the originals.
     - Assign a new unique identifier to each merged claim (e.g., "Merged Claim 1").
     - Retain the highest importance score among the original claims for the merged claim.

   - **Handle Technical Details and Supporting Evidence**:
     - For each merged claim, collect all associated technical details and supporting evidence from the original claims.
     - **If technical details or supporting evidence are too similar**:
       - Merge them into a single entry that combines the key points.
     - **If they provide distinct information**:
       - Keep both entries to preserve all unique contributions.

   - **Update References**:
     - Update the "claim_reference" fields in technical details and supporting evidence to reflect the new merged claim identifiers.
     - Ensure all references are correctly linked and that there are no duplicates.

3. **Output**:
   - Provide a consolidated JSON object with:
     - The merged claims, each with its text and updated importance score.
     - The technical details and supporting evidence, with updated claim references, merged where appropriate.

**Instructions**:

- **Merging Criteria**:
  - **Claims**: Merge claims that convey the same idea or contribution, even if phrased differently.
  - **Technical Details and Supporting Evidence**: Merge entries that are substantially similar to avoid redundancy. Keep entries that offer unique information.

- **Output Format**:

```json
{
  "claims": {
    "Merged Claim 1": {
      "text": "Text of the merged claim.",
      "importance_score": [updated importance score]
    },
    // ... additional merged claims
  },
  "technical_details": [
    {
      "claim_reference": ["Merged Claim 1"],
      "detail": "Merged technical detail supporting Merged Claim 1"
    },
    // ... additional technical details
  ],
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {
      "claim_reference": ["Merged Claim 1"],
      "evidence": "Merged evidence supporting Merged Claim 1"
    },
    // ... additional supporting evidence
  ]
}
